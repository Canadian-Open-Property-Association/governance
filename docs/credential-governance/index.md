## Governance Framework

All credentials follow the COPA governance framework which ensures:

- **Interoperability** - Credentials work across all COPA member applications
- **Trust** - Issuers are verified and registered in the COPA Trust Registry
- **Privacy** - Selective disclosure enables minimal data sharing
- **Compliance** - Credentials meet regulatory requirements (FINTRAC, provincial regulations)

## Version Control

All governance documents are version-controlled in the
[COPA GitHub repository](https://github.com/Canadian-Open-Property-Association/governance).
